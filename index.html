    <section class="gameIntro">Game Play Guidelines: Use the "Start" button to randomly decide which player will start the game. Each player starts out with 7 random cards in their hand. A card will be placed on the board from the draw pile. The first player will see if they can play/place a corresponding card (matching by color or number to the card displayed on the board) from the cards in their hand. If they are unable to, they must draw a card. At the end of the turn, that player must click on the "End Turn" button. The turn then goes to the opposing player to see if they can place a card from their hand onto the board. The first player to get rid of all of their cards in their hand wins.</section>
    <section class="gameIntro">*If at any point a player only has one card left in their hand, they must acknowledge this by clicking on the "Uno" button before they end their turn. Or else, if the opposing player clicks "Uno" on the following turn, the player who failed to acknowledge "Uno" while only having one card left in their hand must draw four cards to their hand. </section>
